For the first year of my program with your company, I plan to learn knowledge and expand my skills. 
During the second year, I see myself being able to work very independently and be a competent staff that works collaboratively with other team members to successfully manage a project. 
In five years, I would like to be an industry expert within your company that others can come to for ideas and help. 
I would like to keep myself up to date with new technologies and best practices in the data industry to ensure I can deliver the best results in my current and future roles. 
Also, I would like to move into a mentorship role, where I can guide and mentor the new grads and a team to success.
Once we were doing a project, and we realised three days before a project deadline that two of our teams are using incompatible software tools.
As part of the team members, I remained calm and tried to find a way to deal with this without causing any delays.
I talked to other team members and we made a plan that two of the team resourced compatible software tools and the rest were responsible for converting the work into a different format with using these tool.
It was very close but we managed to get everything done on time.
If assigned a task without enough information, I would promptly seek help from my supervisor or colleagues, presenting the problem and seeking a clear solution while gathering any necessary information. 
I would adhere to company policies and procedures while completing the task within the time limit. 
To overcome information gaps, I would first review available information and resources, and then communicate with relevant individuals to seek advice and guidance. 
I would utilize their experience and knowledge to inspire and enable me to accomplish my task. 
Lastly, I would conduct independent research, experiment, and study relevant literature and materials to increase my knowledge and skill to achieve better results.
When it comes to learning a new technology, it's important to start with a thorough understanding of its fundamental concepts and principles, including its purpose, advantages, disadvantages, and workings. 
I usually begin my learning journey by searching for documentation and tutorials from official sources, reference manuals, developer communities, and online resources. 
Once I have a good grasp of the technology, I turn to online courses and training to gain practical skills and solve real-world problems through small-scale projects. 
I also seek advice and information from colleagues, experts, and the developer community to stay current with the latest developments, troubleshoot issues, and gain valuable insights. 
By following these steps, I can quickly and effectively learn new technologies, better prepare for stakeholder projects, and finally deliver high-quality outcomes.
I’ve learned to manage my workload effectively to meet my deadlines. 
For example, during my last semester, I have 3 projects and 1 final exam. 
I prioritise my tasks and create a plan of action to complete them on time. 
First I evaluate the workload and determine the deadlines, complexity and urgency of each project, which project requires my immediate attention and which ones can be postponed. 
Based on the evaluation, I create a to-do list, ensuring that I complete the most critical task first. 
Then is time management, I plan my time effectively by setting specific time blocks for each task and ensuring that I take regular breaks to avoid burnout. 
I also set aside some buffer time for emergencies that may arise. 
At same time, I keep my team members informed about my progress and ask for help if necessary. 
By following these steps, I eventually completed my three projects and final exams achieving a satisfactory score.
From my point of view, handling change in the workplace requires flexibility, adaptability and a willingness to learn and grow. 
I recognise that change can be difficulty for many people, so I remain calm the focus on understanding the reason for the change and the potential benefits it may bring. 
I proactively seek out all kinds of information about the change including what specifically is changing, what other recourses, and training may be needed for the change and what adjustments I should make to allow myself to adapt to the change. 
Based on the information I’ve gathered, I develop a plan to manage the change. 
This may involve setting new priorities, adjusting my work processes and learning new technical skills.
During my spare time, I like to go to a beach on the weekend because this is a good time for me to empty my brain, take myself out from work pressure and enjoy the time with my family. 
Apart from that, I like watching coding tutorials. 
For example, I learnt Python and write some low-level computer games in Python. 
Learning new skills and putting in into application made me feel satisfied.
I used to work in the login department and get exposed to a large volume of data login duties. 
Form then, I started to be passionate about the data industry, which lead me to study data science. 
I found that data analysis is very important because it helps discover useful insights and we can use the insights to make a decision. 
I wish I can use what I’ve learnt to help a company drive commercial actions and help this company to stand out from the competition.
Our project involved using SQL language to efficiently manage the information of various vehicles in the system. 
We implemented a number of features, including the ability to add, delete, and check vehicles as needed. 
To take this a step further, we developed a user-friendly web page that seamlessly connects to a MySQL database using PHP language. 
This allowed us to quickly and easily modify vehicle information directly from the web page interface. 
By utilizing SQL and PHP, we were able to streamline the management of vehicle data and improve the efficiency of the system. 
Also, the web page made it much easier for multiple users to access and make changes to the database, further improving the usability of the system.
The project focused on analyzing sponsored political posts on Facebook targeted at US users, which involved a significant amount of data cleaning and organization. 
Spark was used to effectively clean and extract high-quality data from the dataset. 
Then used Tableau to visualize the data, including images and charts, to gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns within the dataset. 
By analyzing the data, they were able to draw insightful conclusions that informed the mentor's research on political advertising on social media. 
The use of both Spark and Tableau allowed for efficient data processing and presentation, which eventually contributed to the success of the project.
My project aims to restore mosaics on human faces. 
Initially, I train the model using a large dataset of face images. 
Then, I break down each face into individual pixel points, and utilize the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm to implement image restoration. 
The RNN algorithm generates the next pixel point by using the previous pixel point as input, and this process repeats until the entire image is restored. 
By using RNN, my project can effectively restore the mosaic of an image in a precise and accurate manner.
