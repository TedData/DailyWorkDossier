162. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this data engineering position with your company today.
163. I graduated from UQ with a master's degree in data science in 2022. 
164. Initially, I was working as a laboratory assistant at Symbio for 6 years in Australia. 
165. During this time, I have been quite exposed to the login role of how these samples were being logged into the computer and how these data were transferred back to the customers, and that’s what led me to study data science. 
166. Now I want to pursue my career as a data engineer because I am passionate about building and creating things that make others’ work easier. 
167. Working on data is varied, it requires intense technical skills which I enjoy, and there is always something new and challenging to work on.
168. A good team player is a good communicator; I always inform the team about what’s happening. 
169. I always keep the team updated on my progress to ensure everyone is working toward the same goal to avoid repeating work or miscommunication.
170. A good team player always works collaboratively within the team and actively contributes to the group in order to complete tasks and manage projects.
171. A good team player always actively listens to co-workers/team members, respects their ideas and is willing to share responsibility when the team experiences difficulties.
172. A good team player also needs to be flexible. 
173. I am able and always get myself ready to quickly adapt to new circumstances. 
174. I always look forward to helping whenever the team needs me. 
175. For example, we have a project due two days later and my manager hopes I can work overtime with the team to finish it before the deadline. 
176. I’m flexible and available when they need me to work.
177. As a new grad with data science background, I wish to join a global tech-powered company to start gaining experience and exposure myself to build a long term career in data analysis. 
178. It’s well known that your company is a technology and business focused company that provides IT and business consulting services to a variety of industries. 
179. Also, your company has accredited courses and is committed to offering the highest standards of training in technology. 
180. I wish to join your company because it offers new grad foundational training and then place them to relevant areas to achieve work experience. 
181. I really like this program because this allows me to focus on individual learning with required support at the beginning and offers me an opportunity to work in a supportive work environment compared to other company.
182. What I’ve learnt from the university makes me a competent candidate for this position, which also will be of benefit to your company.
183. I believe my knowledge and technical skills will help data scientists and analysts to quickly access the company’s large database and to identify trends and customer behaviour, in turn, increase customer satisfaction and profits.
184. I am keen to learn and I am a quick learner, I can easily pick up new skills if required. 
185. For example, when I work on a project at university, I came across a new software language NEO4J that I never used, so I watched lots of tutorial videos and search articles about how to use this language and then did lots of practice on NEO4J. 
186. As a result, I used one day to learn NEO4J and apply it to my knowledge graph project for creating the recommendation system.
187. I am a good team player; I work collaboratively with the team members, respect their opinions, respond to a task on time, and am willing to share responsibility when coming across difficulties.
188. At this stage, my biggest weakness is the lack of industry-level experience.
189. I've learned the basics such as database principles, advanced database systems and Python etc but I'm not at a point where I can satisfy all project requirements all by myself. 
190. However, I am a fast learner and very keen to learn different coding languages so I am confident that I will be able to contribute to different components and adapt quickly to different processes and tools.
191. Now, in terms of how to improve my weakness, I think the first step is to conduct some self-learning so I can familiarise myself with it and get ready to use the tool. 
192. If I come across any difficulties I should seek help from my senior colleague or manager to overcome the issue. 
193. Apart from that, I want to make sure that I dive super deep into the work so that I can understand project constraints under different circumstances. 
194. In doing so, finally, I can conquer my weakness and support the team delivering insights to our stakeholders.
195. As a data engineer, I've mostly struggled with fulfilling the needs of all the departments within the company.
196. Different departments often have conflicting demands. 
197. So, balancing them with the capabilities of the company's infrastructure has been quite challenging. 
198. Nevertheless, this has been a valuable learning experience for me, as it's given me the chance to learn how these departments work and their role in the overall structure of the company.
199. I will try not to engage in conflict but would rather listen to other people’s opinions first.
200. We can sit down and have some coffee for a chat. 
201. I believe the most important principle is to do the right thing for our customers and stakeholders. 
202. I am very open-minded and am willing to accept the idea if that’s the right thing to do. 
203. Also, I am very excited to share my ideas about discussing with others to find the best solution because, you know, people are reasonable.
204. Honestly, I think everyone is under pressure more or less, so it is about how to adapt to an efficient routine to help you to reduce the amount of pressure. 
205. So I will work on the most urgent or important tasks which require more focused time to complete it. 
206. So first thing in my day, I will go through my inbox and take a look at the calendar to see what my day looks like. 
207. If my calendar is pretty open, then I will try to prioritise work that requires a chuck of focused time, like writing code. 
208. If my day is packed with meetings, then I will prioritise the day to prepare the necessary material for the meeting to make it as efficient as possible. 
209. If I feel stressed, I will give myself 5 minutes of coffee time to relax my mind.
210. Another important thing is, to reach out for help when needed! You have a team for a reason and the success of the team relies on open communication.
211. Firstly, I will build a rapport with my stakeholders by demonstrating my domain knowledge and technical skills so they can trust me I can deliver good insights to their business and share their concerns with me. 
212. Then we will discuss the rough delivery time to manage their expectations.
213. During the projects, I will initially make some assumptions and then always involve the stakeholders if they like my ideas or not, trying as much as I can to deliver the insight that they expected. 
214. Consequently, adjust my analysis based on their feedback.
215. For the first year of my program with your company, I plan to learn knowledge and expand my skills. 
216. During the second year, I see myself being able to work very independently and be a competent staff that works collaboratively with other team members to successfully manage a project. 
217. In five years, I would like to be an industry expert within your company that others can come to for ideas and help. 
218. I would like to keep myself up to date with new technologies and best practices in the data industry to ensure I can deliver the best results in my current and future roles. 
219. Also, I would like to move into a mentorship role, where I can guide and mentor the new grads and a team to success.
220. Once we were doing a project, and we realised three days before a project deadline that two of our teams are using incompatible software tools.
221. As part of the team members, I remained calm and tried to find a way to deal with this without causing any delays.
222. I talked to other team members and we made a plan that two of the team resourced compatible software tools and the rest were responsible for converting the work into a different format with using these tool.
223. It was very close but we managed to get everything done on time.
224. If assigned a task without enough information, I would promptly seek help from my supervisor or colleagues, presenting the problem and seeking a clear solution while gathering any necessary information. 
225. I would adhere to company policies and procedures while completing the task within the time limit. 
226. To overcome information gaps, I would first review available information and resources, and then communicate with relevant individuals to seek advice and guidance. 
227. I would utilize their experience and knowledge to inspire and enable me to accomplish my task. 
228. Lastly, I would conduct independent research, experiment, and study relevant literature and materials to increase my knowledge and skill to achieve better results.
229. When it comes to learning a new technology, it's important to start with a thorough understanding of its fundamental concepts and principles, including its purpose, advantages, disadvantages, and workings. 
230. I usually begin my learning journey by searching for documentation and tutorials from official sources, reference manuals, developer communities, and online resources. 
231. Once I have a good grasp of the technology, I turn to online courses and training to gain practical skills and solve real-world problems through small-scale projects. 
232. I also seek advice and information from colleagues, experts, and the developer community to stay current with the latest developments, troubleshoot issues, and gain valuable insights. 
233. By following these steps, I can quickly and effectively learn new technologies, better prepare for stakeholder projects, and finally deliver high-quality outcomes.
234. I’ve learned to manage my workload effectively to meet my deadlines. 
235. For example, during my last semester, I have 3 projects and 1 final exam. 
236. I prioritise my tasks and create a plan of action to complete them on time. 
237. First I evaluate the workload and determine the deadlines, complexity and urgency of each project, which project requires my immediate attention and which ones can be postponed. 
238. Based on the evaluation, I create a to-do list, ensuring that I complete the most critical task first. 
239. Then is time management, I plan my time effectively by setting specific time blocks for each task and ensuring that I take regular breaks to avoid burnout. 
240. I also set aside some buffer time for emergencies that may arise. 
241. At same time, I keep my team members informed about my progress and ask for help if necessary. 
242. By following these steps, I eventually completed my three projects and final exams achieving a satisfactory score.
243. From my point of view, handling change in the workplace requires flexibility, adaptability and a willingness to learn and grow. 
244. I recognise that change can be difficulty for many people, so I remain calm the focus on understanding the reason for the change and the potential benefits it may bring. 
245. I proactively seek out all kinds of information about the change including what specifically is changing, what other recourses, and training may be needed for the change and what adjustments I should make to allow myself to adapt to the change. 
246. Based on the information I’ve gathered, I develop a plan to manage the change. 
247. This may involve setting new priorities, adjusting my work processes and learning new technical skills.
248. During my spare time, I like to go to a beach on the weekend because this is a good time for me to empty my brain, take myself out from work pressure and enjoy the time with my family. 
249. Apart from that, I like watching coding tutorials. 
250. For example, I learnt Python and write some low-level computer games in Python. 
251. Learning new skills and putting in into application made me feel satisfied.
252. I used to work in the login department and get exposed to a large volume of data login duties. 
253. Form then, I started to be passionate about the data industry, which lead me to study data science. 
254. I found that data analysis is very important because it helps discover useful insights and we can use the insights to make a decision. 
255. I wish I can use what I’ve learnt to help a company drive commercial actions and help this company to stand out from the competition.
256. Our project involved using SQL language to efficiently manage the information of various vehicles in the system. 
257. We implemented a number of features, including the ability to add, delete, and check vehicles as needed. 
258. To take this a step further, we developed a user-friendly web page that seamlessly connects to a MySQL database using PHP language. 
259. This allowed us to quickly and easily modify vehicle information directly from the web page interface. 
260. By utilizing SQL and PHP, we were able to streamline the management of vehicle data and improve the efficiency of the system. 
261. Also, the web page made it much easier for multiple users to access and make changes to the database, further improving the usability of the system.
262. The project focused on analyzing sponsored political posts on Facebook targeted at US users, which involved a significant amount of data cleaning and organization. 
263. Spark was used to effectively clean and extract high-quality data from the dataset. 
264. Then used Tableau to visualize the data, including images and charts, to gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns within the dataset. 
265. By analyzing the data, they were able to draw insightful conclusions that informed the mentor's research on political advertising on social media. 
266. The use of both Spark and Tableau allowed for efficient data processing and presentation, which eventually contributed to the success of the project.
267. My project aims to restore mosaics on human faces. 
268. Initially, I train the model using a large dataset of face images. 
269. Then, I break down each face into individual pixel points, and utilize the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm to implement image restoration. 
270. The RNN algorithm generates the next pixel point by using the previous pixel point as input, and this process repeats until the entire image is restored. 
271. By using RNN, my project can effectively restore the mosaic of an image in a precise and accurate manner.
272. After 400 children, some as young as 10, have gate crashed (未被邀请或未经许可就闯入) a party in Logan that disintegrated into violence (局面逐渐走向 演变为暴力或混乱的状态).
